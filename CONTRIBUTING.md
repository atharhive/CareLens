# Contributing to CareLens

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CareLens! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## Where do I start?

If you're looking for a place to start, check out the open issues on GitHub. You can also join our Discord server to discuss ideas with the community.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment** by following the instructions in the `docs/setup.md` file.
3.  **Make your changes** and ensure that the code lints and tests pass.
4.  **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

## Coding Conventions

-   **Python:** We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide and use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.
-   **TypeScript/React:** We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce code style.
-   **Commit Messages:** We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `README.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
